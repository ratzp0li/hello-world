Just another repository

Hey, just another CS student here.
Pretty cool how I'm actually learning how this site works.
I've been linked to this site so many times before and it's always confused the heck out of me. I've never understood how it works.
Now I see it'll probably be a load of fun figuring out how to make things work. 
I may develop a taste for technology yet.
